# Study for Mapping Supplementary Cementitious Materials

**Status:** *Work in Progress*
**Note:** The data and analyses in this repository are incomplete and actively evolving.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the working materials, data, and analysis for the capstone project of the **Yale School of the Environment – Environmental Data Science Certificate Program**.

The study investigates methods for mapping, analyzing, and understanding **Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs)** across different regions.
This is an ongoing project, and the contents will be updated frequently as the research progresses.

Because this is active work, some datasets, notebooks, scripts, and outputs may be partial, experimental, or subject to revision.
